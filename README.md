<h1> Barber App </h1>

<p>The app would be a tool that aims to help hairdressers to streamline and automate their time.</p>
<p>The client can make an appointment by choosing the service that he wants, and can set the date
and time when he wants to schedule. The appointment will be sent to the barber immediately
after it is done.</p>
<p>To make an appointment, the barbers must add the services they provide. After the appointment
is made by the client in the inbox, the schedule will be displayed, as well as the barber he has
chosen. To make it easier for the barber to see his appointment history, he will have access to a
calendar that will tell him exactly when he had appointments and when not.</p>
